In the digital age, social media platforms have become pivotal arenas for communication, networking, and information dissemination. With the exponential growth of user-generated content, there arises a pressing need to understand and predict user behaviours and preferences. This project aims to conduct an exploratory analysis and prediction task using a diverse dataset encompassing demographic, behavioural, and socio-economic attributes extracted from various social media websites.

The dataset comprises crucial features such as age, gender, time spent on the platform, interests, location, demographics, profession, income level, indebtedness status, homeownership, and car ownership. 

The primary objective is to predict the indebtedness status of social media users based on their profile characteristics and behavioural patterns. 
The results of the machine learning algorithms applied to the dataset indicate an average accuracy of approximately 51.5% across all models. While this accuracy level may seem moderate, it provides valuable insights into the predictive performance of the models and sheds light on the factors influencing user indebtedness on social media platforms.

Despite the modest accuracy, it's important to note that the predictive models offer significant potential for understanding user behaviors related to indebtedness. The algorithms successfully capture patterns and relationships within the data, allowing for the identification of key predictors of indebtedness among social media users.

The results suggest that while demographic, behavioral, and socio-economic attributes play a role in predicting user indebtedness, the relationship is complex and multifaceted. Factors such as age, income level, and homeownership status may influence indebtedness status to some extent, but other variables not captured in the dataset may also contribute significantly to the prediction accuracy.
